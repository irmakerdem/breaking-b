### Reflection
- After successfully fetching the data from the API, I realized that one of the images was not rendering on my website. I noticed that that image's URL contained the word "static" where as the other similar PNG images contained "vignette". This discrepancy caused me to create new function that dynamically would change any URL that contained "static" even though only one of the 62 images. Later, I realized that instead of passing this method into various components, the best solution was to go to the root of the problem (i.e. during the fetch). Hence, I forced the data to be filtered immediately during the fetch instead of cleaning up after fetch was completed. I will be contacting the API owner/maintainer so others do not have to go through this trouble like I did.
- I had initially created many divs and classes for styling purposes. Very quickly I realized how messy this technique was in React. Due to the compliling of Webpack and React, I needed very minimal CSS styling to get the home page to render images with a specific size as well as them being responsive (using flex box) for bigger/smaller screen sizes. I learned that em's are more friendly for creating a responsive app than percentages.
- This project was my first time for 3 concepts. 1) Hooks. It was very satisfying to never have to use the word "this" in the codebase. 2) Component Using. I reused the same component of Card in the home page and the favorites page instead of creating a FavoriteCard component. This made my codebased very modular! 3) Prop types. Using prop types proved to be a simple new addition to the code base that explicitly clarified the data types that were used in codebase.
