### Introduction
Breaking Bad is an app built to help you study üìö for Breaking Bad Trivia Night. User sees a list of characters on page load, click on a character, and see their details üìù. If there are any character's information you keep getting stuck on üòñ, you can üíö favorite and unfavorite them!

This app fetches data from [The Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/).

### Deployment
Project can be viewed [here]().

### Technologies
- JavaScript
- React (hooks and proptypes)
- React Router
- HTML
- CSS
- API fetch
- Cypress (E2E testing)
- Figma & FigmaJam

### Set Up
1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/irmakerdem/breaking-bad).
2. `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. To run tests, run `npm run cypress`.
5. Start the server by running `npm start` and view at http://localhost:8080/.

- User can filter Home Page for characters' status (dead/alive)
- Breaking Bad theme song plays on page load
- Filter out Better Call Saul characters

- Update styling/design for better UX/UI

### Reflection
- After successfully fetching the data from the API, I realized that one of the images was not rendering on my website. I noticed that that image's URL contained the word "static" where as the other similar PNG images contained "vignette". This discrepancy caused me to create new function that dynamically would change any URL that contained "static" even though only one of the 62 images. Later, I realized that instead of passing this method into various components, the best solution was to go to the root of the problem (i.e. during the fetch). Hence, I forced the data to be filtered immediately during the fetch instead of cleaning up after fetch was completed. I will be contacting the API owner/maintainer so others do not have to go through this trouble like I did.
- I had initially created many divs and classes for styling purposes. Very quickly I realized how messy this technique was in React. Due to the compliling of Webpack and React, I needed very minimal CSS styling to get the home page to render images with a specific size as well as them being responsive (using flex box) for bigger/smaller screen sizes. I learned that em's are more friendly for creating a responsive app than percentages.
- This project was my first time using 3 concepts. 1) Hooks. It was very satisfying to never have to use the word "this" in the codebase. 2) Reusing Components. I reused the Card in the Home Page and the Favorites Page instead of creating an unnecessary FavoriteCard component. This made my codebased very modular! 3) Prop types. Using prop types proved to be a simple new addition to the code base that explicitly clarified the data types that were used in codebase. 
- When rendering the Error component, I ran into errors on the Details Page with the path being set to "*". To resolve this issue, I added "/details" to the Details Page path.
